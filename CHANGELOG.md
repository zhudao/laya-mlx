# Changelog

Each release names the upstream [Laya](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya) revision whose host
behavior it follows. Detailed records live in [docs/](docs/README.md).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-10-29

Follows upstream **v0.4.17** (`fe9a6c35`). [Migration record](docs/MIGRATION_0_4_17.md).

- **Language routing:** `detect_language(..., explain=True)` reports why a language was chosen;
  updated Unicode script lookup and English/Vietnamese detection fixes.
- **Long documents:** answer attribution survives end hooks that reorder results; missing
  answers raise, and replaced or edited answers carry no misleading window attribution.
- **Stricter validation (may raise where 0.5.0 accepted input):** reliability calibration
  precision, malformed integration responses, evaluation cardinality and metric checks, confidence
  overflow and digest paths.
- **HTTP and CLI:** request-body deadlines, batch token budgets, configurable remote User-Agent,
  BOM-aware input files; the CLI reports read/encoding/JSON errors before loading a model.
- **Fix:** `predict_batch` no longer groups integer or boolean keys with their string equivalents
  (`1` vs `"1"`), which returned the wrong key types for later requests.
- **Fix:** with `hooks_concurrent=False`, a timed-out hook keeps the serialization lock until it
  exits, and a hook whose deadline passes while waiting is never called.
- Linux host-only CI job; the real-checkpoint validation harness targets v0.4.17.
- Validation: 63/63 fixtures for all three checkpoints in FP32 and FP16 against the v0.4.17
  reference, 100 stable calls each. Performance figures were not re-measured for this release.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-10-20

Follows upstream **v0.4.12** (`ffc14201`). [Release notes](docs/RELEASE_0_5_0.md) ·
[migration](docs/MIGRATION_0_4.md) · [qualification](docs/QUALIFICATION_0_4_12.md).

- Batch and long-text inference, structured decisions, hooks, calibration, evaluation, HTTP/MCP
  serving and LangChain/LlamaIndex/CrewAI/Agno integrations.
- `Router()` keeps two models resident by default (`max_loaded=1` restores the old limit).
- Scalar choice labels are accepted; invalid requests use upstream error types and messages.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-10

Selectively follows upstream **v0.4.1** (`1adc59f`).

- **Behavior change:** `Router()` defaults to `multilingual` for undecided text, including short
  inputs such as `"refund me"`. Use `Router(default="english")` for the previous fallback.
- Custom checkpoint registration (`register`, `unregister`, `models=`), concurrent-safe lifecycle,
  and MLX buffer-cache release on eviction.
- `min_confidence` gate with per-bucket thresholds; `predict_tournament` for large choice sets.
- Checkpoints with `"option_layout": "parallel"` are supported end to end.
- Language detection no longer treats all-capital acronyms as French or Spanish.
- [Validation report](benchmarks/results/upstream-v041-validation.json): 378/378 argmax agreements.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-02

Selectively follows upstream `4aa6761` (v0.3.23 source tree).

- Conversation-list states keep their newest tokens when context fills.
- `noul` criteria accept only `false`/`true` keys; optional `labels=` changes the displayed words.
- `answer_confidence` on every answer; `usage` reports state truncation and colliding option spans.
- Calibration temperatures are clamped to `[0.5, 5.0]` (upstream v0.3.5).
- Email cleaning keeps ordinary requests and recognizes multilingual footers.

## 0.1.0 – 0.2.0 — 2026-09-19 to 2026-09-22

Initial MLX port: native encoder and decision heads, pre-converted checkpoints and benchmarks.
These releases predate the repository's version tags.
